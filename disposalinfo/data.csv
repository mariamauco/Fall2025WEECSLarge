Battery,Various types of batteries,"Batteries Recycling Preparations
1. Power down your device, then remove the battery and inspect it. If the battery has leaked any of its internal liquid, you need to treat this battery with a bit more care and it may not be accepted for recycling — check with the location before you take a leading batteries for recycling. It’s best to clean out the inside of your device to remove any crust that the liquid left behind.
2. Store batteries so that their active ends are not in contact with each other, which can cause a spark and fires in your home or the recycling facility. In fact, there were 390 battery-related fires at recycling sites in 2022. Tape the end of the active terminal or line up all batteries so they won’t shift. This will prevent damage to the batteries themselves.
3. Never store spent batteries in a location where they can overheat or freeze, as it can harm batteries and potentially start a fire.

Alkaline (AA, AAA): Most areas allow these in regular trash, but recycling is better. Check with your local municipality, waste hauler, and local solid waste district to see if they collect single-use batteries for recycling or if they accept batteries during household hazardous waste collection days. Some local hardware stores will also accept single-use batteries for recycling, but it is not always free. More states are banning batteries from landfills, so it may be illegal to put them in the trash.

Rechargeable (Li-ion): NEVER trash. They are a major fire hazard. Take to a certified drop-off. Rechargeable batteries are often easier to recycle than their single-use counterparts due to governmental regulations. Call2Recycle is the nonprofit that leads the United States’ largest rechargeable battery recycling program and they have a recycling search locator to help you find a retailer that accepts rechargeable batteries, usually for free.",3.65,,,"https://www.call2recycle.org/
